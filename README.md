## How it works
The renders in Fig. 1-3 are made using a very simple Blender scene setup shown in Fig. 4. The scene contains a region in which space-time is curved due to a blackhole in the center (the blackhole is about 1/60th in size compared to the sphere in Blender). The other four small spheres are the moon like objects you see in the animation. And then there is a camera. That is all (note there is also an HDRI image not visible in the 3d view of Fig. 4).
